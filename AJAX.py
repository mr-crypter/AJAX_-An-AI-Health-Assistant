Not everyone experiences these symptoms, and they can vary between individuals.",
            "What should I do during a heart attack?": "During a heart attack, it's crucial to act quickly. Call emergency services immediately (108 or 112 (India) or your local emergency number). While waiting for help, chew and swallow aspirin (if available) to help reduce blood clotting. Stay calm, and if you have been prescribed nitroglycerin, take it as directed. If you are experiencing chest pain, sit down and rest in a comfortable position. Avoid exertion or stress.",
